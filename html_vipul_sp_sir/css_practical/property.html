				    If you feel content, you're satisfied and happy. The content of a book, movie, or song is what it's about: the topic. This word has two main meanings. The first has to do with being pleased and satisfied (feeling content) or making someone else feel happy and at peace with things (contenting them)..
				    Signs Proves You Are Lucky. I’ve heard many people saying- I am too unlucky, my luck doesn’t support me, that person is rich because he is lucky, that person is not successful because he/she is unlucky, she always tops in the class- what a lucky girl, oh man he has such a cute girlfriend-what a lucky man. Like seriously, all of it happens because of luck. No, I don’t think so. I do believe that we create our own luck and lack of it.

					Luck depends on how quick we are towards the opportunity. How much desire, passion we have related to something. Luck depends on how open we are towards taking chances and how quick we are towards making decisions. Luck depends on our decisions and believes. If you always play safe, even after getting opportunities, still you stick to that same place, and later crib that you are unlucky, your friends are doing great compared to you, and all of it is happening because you are unlucky or because they are lucky. Then this attitude is something which makes you unlucky. Not accepting your fault and responsibilities is what makes you Unlucky, not working hard; not being alert for opportunities is what makes you unlucky.
